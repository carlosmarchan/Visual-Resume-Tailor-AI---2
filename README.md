You spent hours crafting the perfect resume in Canva, Figma, or Word. It looks amazing. But now you have to tailor it for every single job applicationâ€”a tedious, manual process that risks messing up your beautiful layout with every text change.

**Visual Resume Tailor AI is your one-click application toolkit.** It's a sophisticated application that uses AI to generate a complete package for a specific jobâ€”a rewritten resume, a tailored cover letter, and ATS keywordsâ€”all while leaving your original design pixel-perfect. Stop the copy-paste grind. Start applying faster.

## How It Works: The "Surgical" AI Editing Strategy

We knew a standard "AI image editor" wouldn't work. They're prone to garbled text and broken layouts. So, we developed a more reliable, three-step process designed for precision and quality.

### Step 1: Intelligent Text Analysis (`gemini-2.5-flash`)

First, we focus only on the words. You upload your resume images and the job description. The AI reads everything and generates a complete package of text-only assets: a tailored cover letter, ATS keywords, and a detailed list of proposed resume edits.

### Step 2: Your Editorial Review

This is the most important step. We present every suggested resume change to you. You see the original text and the new text side-by-side. Using simple toggles, you approve the changes you like and reject the ones you don't. Nothing happens to your visual resume without your explicit permission.

### Step 3: "Sequential Atomic Patching" (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`)

This is our secret sauce. Once you confirm your edits, the visual generation begins. Instead of asking the AI to "re-create" the whole page (which is unreliable), we command it to perform a series of tiny, surgical edits.

For each page, it applies *only the changes you approved*, one by one:

1.  It takes the **original image** and the **first approved change**.
2.  The AI performs a "micro-edit"â€”finding the exact text and replacing it while perfectly matching the style and reflowing the surrounding content.
3.  The **output image** from this first step becomes the **input image** for the second approved change.
4.  This process repeats, creating a chain where each change is a small, "atomic patch" on top of the last.

This sequential method is like a microscopic graphic designer working at lightning speed. It dramatically reduces errors and ensures the final visual resume meets the highest quality standards.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API
    -   **`gemini-2.5-flash`**: Used for all text generation, analysis, and JSON structuring tasks due to its speed and strong instruction-following capabilities.
    -   **`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`**: The core multi-modal model used for the "Sequential Atomic Patching" process, enabling precise in-painting and text replacement on the resume images.
-   **PDF Generation**: `jsPDF` for client-side PDF creation.

## Getting Started

This is a web-based application designed to run in a modern browser.

### Prerequisites

You must have a valid Google Gemini API key.

### Configuration

The application requires the API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

```
# Example:
API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
```

The application code in `services/geminiService.ts` will automatically pick up this variable. **Do not hardcode your API key in the source code.**

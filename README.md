# Visual Resume Tailor AI: Your One-Click Application Toolkit.

You spent hours crafting the perfect resume in Canva, Figma, or Word. It looks amazing. But now you have to tailor it for every single job applicationâ€”a tedious, manual process that risks messing up your beautiful layout with every text change.

**Visual Resume Tailor AI is your one-click application toolkit.** It's a sophisticated application that uses AI to generate a complete package for a specific jobâ€”a rewritten resume, a tailored cover letter, and ATS keywordsâ€”all while leaving your original design pixel-perfect. Stop the copy-paste grind. Start applying faster.

## How It Works: The "Surgical" AI Editing Strategy

We knew a standard "AI image editor" wouldn't work. They're prone to garbled text and broken layouts. So, we developed a more reliable, multi-step process designed for precision and quality. For a complete technical breakdown of this workflow and the R&D that led to it, see the [Application Logic](./docs/LOGIC.md) and [Image Generation History](./docs/image_generation_history.md) documents.

### Step 1: Intelligent Text Analysis (`gemini-2.5-flash`)

First, we focus only on the words. You upload your resume images and the job description. The AI reads everything and generates a complete package of text-only assets: a tailored cover letter, ATS keywords, and a detailed list of proposed resume edits for your review.

### Step 2: Your Editorial Review

This is the most important step. We present every suggested resume change to you. You see the original text and the new text side-by-side. Using simple toggles, you approve the changes you like and reject the ones you don't. Nothing happens to your visual resume without your explicit permission.

### Step 3: Final Asset Generation (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`)

This is our secret sauce. Once you confirm your edits, the visual generation begins. Instead of asking the AI to "re-create" the whole page (which is unreliable), we command it to perform a batch of surgical edits on a per-page basis.

1.  For each page, the AI receives the **original image** and a **"batch"** of all your approved edits for that specific page.
2.  It performs all edits in one go, finding the exact text and replacing it while perfectly matching the style and intelligently reflowing the surrounding content.
3.  In parallel, a final plain-text version of the resume is generated for easy copy-pasting into online forms.

This "batched" method is highly efficient and dramatically reduces errors, ensuring the final visual resume meets the highest quality standards.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API
    -   **`gemini-2.5-flash`**: Used for all text generation, analysis, and JSON structuring tasks due to its speed and strong instruction-following capabilities.
    -   **`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`**: The core multi-modal model used for the "Batched Changes per Page" process, enabling precise in-painting and text replacement on the resume images. (See our [detailed usage analysis](./docs/NANO_BANANA_API_USAGE.md)).
-   **PDF Generation**: `jsPDF` for client-side PDF creation.

## Getting Started

This is a web-based application designed to run in a modern browser.

### Prerequisites

You must have a valid Google Gemini API key.

### Configuration

The application requires the API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

```
# Example:
API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
```

The application code in `services/geminiService.ts` will automatically pick up this variable. **Do not hardcode your API key in the source code.**

---

## Project Structure

The application follows a modular, screen-based architecture orchestrated by the main `App.tsx` component. For a detailed breakdown of how the components interact, see the [Component & Rendering Flow documentation](./docs/COMPONENT_FLOW.md).
